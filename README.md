# FTB Rift Helper

An addon mod for FTB Team Bases and FTB Ocean Mobs, specifically made for FTB Ocean Block 2. Its purpose is to:

* Set up per-team regions in the Rift dimension when the team's base is set up in the overworld, using FTB Team Bases region relocation functionality
* Send players to the correct location in the Rift dimension when they activate the portal in the overworld
* Reset per-team regions in the Rift when the Rift Weaver boss has been killed _and_ all chunks for that region have been unloaded
